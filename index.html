{% capture bio %}

I write software, make pasta and live concert visuals, and live in NYC.

I’ve tried [putting asynchronous programming in C++](https://github.com/s4y/team), [putting a window manager in a web browser](http://localhub.github.io/home/localhub-home-example.png), and [putting live HTML in a terminal](https://github.com/s4y/Hoisin). I was in batch[2] of [The Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/).

Right now, my favorite programming concepts are coroutines, closures, and idempotence. I daydream about strong AI and making programming easier.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/s4y), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Sidnicious), [Keybase](https://keybase.io/sidney), and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/84745/sidnicious). You can email me at [sidney@s4y.us](mailto:sidney@s4y.us).
