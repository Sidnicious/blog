I write software and live in NYC. I’ve dabbled in [adding asynchronous programming to C++](https://github.com/Sidnicious/team), [putting a window manager in your browser](http://localhub.github.io/home/localhub-home-example.png), and [putting live HTML in your shell](https://github.com/Sidnicious/Hoisin). I was in batch[2] of [The Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/).

My favorite programming concepts (for now) are coroutines, closures, and idempotence. I secretly dream of working on autonomous cars and strong AI.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/Sidnicious), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Sidnicious), [Keybase](https://keybase.io/sidney), and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/84745/sidnicious). You can email me at [sidney@s4y.us](mailto:sidney@s4y.us).
