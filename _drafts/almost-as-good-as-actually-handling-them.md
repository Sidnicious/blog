<p>Updated via form on website, holy shit it didn&rsquo;t break and she noticed that that&rsquo;s what I changed!</p>
<p>> Dear Mr. San Martin,</p>
<p>> Thank you for visiting Liberty Mutual Insurance&rsquo;s eService.  I have received your email regarding the misspelling of your name.</p>
<p>> I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you, but our system currently does not make provision for accents to be added to the spelling of names.  I have made no changes to the policy at this time.</p>
<p>> If you have any additional questions, please reply to this email or call our office at the number below.</p>
<p>> Before I end this email, I would like to take this opportunity to welcome you to Liberty Mutual! The next time you are online, discover all the benefits available with your Liberty Mutual policy by visiting us at: www.libertymutualimages.com&#47;Many_Benefits&#47;index.html.</p>
