<p>Apps-accounts-as-Google-accounts has been pretty frustrating for me, using Google Apps to host my personal email address (I'm sure it's better for businesses, where the email addresses are *not* each person&rsquo;s primary, personal one).</p>
<p>When you log into a Google Apps account to access email, calendars, etc., you use a username that's specific to your organization &mdash; the first part of your email address &mdash; and you do it at a separate login page from other Google services.</p>
<p>In the past, this separation meant that, if you wanted to, you could associate a Google Apps email address with a regular Google account, just like any other email address.</p>
<p>This worked pretty well, except when anyone invited me to a calendar event or a Google doc, the invitation would go to my domain's special instance of Google Docs, not my Google account's instance.</p>
<p>When Google rolled out Apps-accounts-are-Google-accounts-too, </p>
