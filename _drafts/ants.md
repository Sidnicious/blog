<p>My mom sent me a note this afternoon, before I got home home. There are ants, she said. &ldquo;I know how you love to rescue insects, but it&rsquo;s a hopeless cause with the ants &mdash; unless you want to spend your evening chasing them around the kitchen and opening the front door over and over.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve resorted to vacuuming them up, and I&rsquo;m leaving the vacuum cleaner in the kitchen for you. Just tell yourself that they will be happy with their buddies among the crumbs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a family tradition not to kill bugs. For as long as I can remember, we&rsquo;ve kept a litle box marked &ldquo;Bug Box&rdquo; somewhere handy. Whenever one showed up, one of us would find a way to get it into the box, and then would take the box outside and release (or, more often, throw) the captive outside. If a bug couldn&rsquo;t be captured, we ignored it as well as we could.</p>
<p>For me the reason was clear: my rights, even inside the house, did not extend to ending another life.</p>
<p>But tonight the vacuum cleaner was there in the kitchen when I got home. My mom was not home. I counted two ants on the counter by the sink, two on the stove, one on the counter by the stove, and two on the floor. I couldn&rsquo;t leave them there because the night would, if I did, not end without at least a few dead ants smeared about the kitchen, or in my stomach, or on myself.</p>
<p>I went and got a sheet of clean white paper, because the ants were too small for the bug box. Its walls were thicker than them, so even when placed delicately on its edge in the path of an ant, it would see the edge of the box as a wall, not a step into a new life. So I took the paper, and I put it in the path of an ant.</p>
<p>One, two, three, four times I put the paper in the path of an ant, waited for it to walk on, carried the paper out through the front door, and blew it off the paper and out into the night.</p>

<p>When you try to pick up an ant with a vaccum cleaner, it clings to the surface it is on. It takes much more suction than you would believe needed to pick up something of that size.</p>
