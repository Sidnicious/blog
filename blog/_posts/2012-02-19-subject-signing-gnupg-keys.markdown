title: 'Subject: Signing gnupg keys '

Got this email out of the blue and I have no idea what to make of it. I asked in the `#gnupg` IRC channel on Freenode and got little insight. Not being at all familiar with Spain&rsquo;s ID card system doesn&rsquo;t help.

Here at Spain we have an [ID Card][1] with a [x509 certificate inside][2], this certificate is provided by my goverment with the control of the police, so this certificate is full legal and it's like handmade signature.

I&rsquo;m very curious whether this guy&rsquo;s intentions are pure and, if not, what he&rsquo;s trying to do.
