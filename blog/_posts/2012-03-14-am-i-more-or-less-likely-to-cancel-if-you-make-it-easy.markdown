title: Am I more or less likely to cancel if you make it easy to do so?
---
Here's a message I just sent to a big-name credit monitoring service as part of a we&rsquo;re-sorry-you-cancelled survey:

> I was still in the trial period &mdash; when I first signed up I looked around the website to find out how I could cancel, if I wanted to, and I didn't find anything. There was no button in my account settings, there was nothing in the FAQs or the help section about how to do it. I searched around online and found out (from other websites) that I had to call in and talk to someone during business hours.
> Products that make it so much more difficult to cancel than to start using them make me uncomfortable.
I like paying for stuff online. I *think* that when I know I can cancel a subscription service really, really easily I stick with it longer &mdash; the option's always there, any hour of the day.

But that's a *huge guess.* I wonder if there&rsquo;s an accepted answer?
