<p>I&rsquo;m moving out of my mom&rsquo;s house, into my first apartment, in New York.</p>
<p>This evening, I took a walk around my new neighborhood. I found a launder, a bank, and a grocery store, and I stopped in a pharmacy to buy some essentials &mdash; tootpaste, soap and the like. After a couple of minutes, a man wearing an undershirt with a thin white t-shirt came up to me and asked if I could &ldquo;help him out&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not asking for money,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;just some soap, maybe some detergent. I&rsquo;m in a program[^1].&rdquo; Sure. I&rsquo;m new to the city and I just got lucky enough to have [a job](http:&#47;&#47;okcupid.com&#47;) that I love doing and that pays me well enough to live there. Let&rsquo;s start off on the right foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you. Thank you so much. God bless you.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t worry about it, I just need a few minutes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll meet you up front. Can I get the detergent with bleach in it? It&rsquo;s a little bit more expensive.&rdquo; Go for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in a program. Just got out of prison. They said not to ask for money, but if you asked people to buy you things that you need, they would. If I can make it six months, I&rsquo;ll get a job and a place to stay. Someone broke into my house[^2], I beat him up real bad. He&rsquo;s paralyzed, and I went to jail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I got to the front of the store, he was waiting there. I asked what kind of job he wanted to get, when he made it out of the program. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get a CDL. I&rsquo;ll drive trucks.&rdquo; Are you from around here? &ldquo;No, no. South Carolina.&rdquo; How did you get up here? &ldquo;Aah, the program. Haha, you&rsquo;re tripping me up, I&rsquo;m forgetting my own story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s kinda sketcky. While we were talking, the cashier was ringing up the order. He had some stuff. Not a huge amount, but it included, say, four big bottles of laundry detergent. Strange, but I just let it go. I paid for the stuff. But, now, I wanted to know more. I told him I thought I forgot something (totally true) and wanted to look around the store. I said goodbye. I found some soap and went back up to the front.</p>
<p>I asked the cashier, an older Jewish woman, if she had ever seen him in there before. No. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t know him? He took advantage of you. I would have said, &lsquo;one is enough&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>  [^1]: He said the name. P-something. Pilades?<br />
  [^2]: Not house, but something like that.</p>
