<p>Dear Sidney San Martin, (Customer ID: 11281849)</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting us. </p>
<p>Once a cancellation request is received no more changes can be made to the DNS settings. However if you still want to keep the domain you need to contact us because we will need information from you inorder for us to turn on the auto renewal of your domain, you can contact us at 1-866-991-2631 we are open 24 by 7, we also checked the expiration date of your domain elainier.com it will expire on 2010-04-12.</p>
<p>If you have any further questions please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
<p>--<br />
Sincerely,<br />
Joniel Roy Rosales<br />

<p>> OK... that's strange, DNS settings are still visible and changeable for the domain on the 1and1 website. I would like it to be set up the same way it was before I disabled auto renewal:<br />

>> Since you turn off the auto renewal of your domain you cannot modify the DNS settings of your domain name, however we can change the DNS settings for you, just provide us the name server or the MX record or the A record that you want to input on the DNS settings of your domain elainier.com. For any domains hosted with 1&1, renewal of the domain is done automatically on your behalf using your payment details. However, if you have canceled the domain from our system or have specifically asked not to renew the domain, the domain will be released to the public at the end of the redemption period which is 30 days after the expiration date. (.com, .net, .org, and .info TLDs).<br />

>>> I disabled auto renew on one of my domains (elainier.com) and DNS seems to have disappeared from it, even though it doesn't expire  for another few weeks. Querying public and 1and1 nameservers is  giving me no results. What's going on?</p>
